  3. Invite all members to join the organization
  4. Create a repository called: `wddm-ttt.github.io` or `wddm-snl.github.io`
      - initialize the repo with a README.md when you create it (it's a checkbox in the Github interface)
  5. All members clone the repository to their local computer
  6. Designate on person to create files/template: `index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/script.js`
