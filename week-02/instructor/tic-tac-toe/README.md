# TIC TAC TOE

## OVERVIEW
What does our game need to do? 

  1. Let's define our functionality
  2. Determine what variables are needed to store
  3. Code a prototype

## FUNCTIONALITY
A quick list of the core tasks

  ### START OF APPLICATION
     - Draw the board
     - Determine who goes first

  ### EACH TURN (LOOPS)
     - Select a box
     - Check for winner (or "cats game")
     - Change turn

  ### END OF APPLICATION
     - Display winner
     - Increase score
     - Start the game again

## FUTURE FEATURES
Some things to consider for future versions

  - Add a turn timer
  - Allow selection of non X/O values
  - Implement computer "AI"
      - Could make the computer have different levels of "intelligence"
  - Calculate your efficiency score to help training
